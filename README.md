# ncaaBracket---Pillow-image
Collaboration site to add a dynamic image for a final four selection to basketball.playoffpredictor.com

The two initial files included here are the main HTML and PERL backend to do the website.  They are not needed for this facet of the project, I am including them for context to help get this github project started.   The output of this github project should be a new (yet to be created) python file that is run on the webserver, which makes the graphic and then uses that image on line 887 of ncaaBracketSimulator.cgi
